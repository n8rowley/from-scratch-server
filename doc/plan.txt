0: REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONSS

- The result of this project is a group of interconnected html 
pages with several types of content
- The content of these pages will describe and provide practice
with several html elements and css selectors

- Solution description: page style will be assisted through the
use of id's and classes. I'm not yet sure how to use both relative
and aboslute URL's

1: SYSTEM ANALYSIS

- Data includes html files, css files, and external reference webpages. 
- All blog page files will be in a common folder; links between
these files will be accomplished by means of relative URL's
- external webpages are links to MDN's website: links to these 
pages will be accomplished by means of absolute URL's
- Output: html pages that can be browsed in a local file system;
every page links to every other page; links direct the user to 
the new page without them having to know the file path

2: DESIGN

- Each blog element will be contained in a `div` with a 
corresponding class attribute
- blog elements include: navigation bar (nav-bar), blog posts 
(blog-post), cheatsheets (cheatsheet), and biographical-blocks (bio);
these classes assit with consistent formatting (font, size, etc)
across pages and sections
- cheatsheat definitions (def) will each be contained in a `div`
- each sequential blog post, cheatsheet, and plan section will
have a unique id; these id's assist with unique background colors 
and other unique details
- a css rule for links inside of definition divs to create
constency across the page
- all text elements will be contained in paragraph elements (<p>)

3: IMPLEMENTATION

4: TESTING & DEBUGGING

- Working links test: for each webpage, scroll to the top of the 
page to where the navigation bar is visible. Click on the top link;
expected result; the browser is redirected to the page that corresponds
to the link that was pressed without any other input.
return to the original page and repeat the process with the second 
link. Repeat for all links, repeat for all pages

- Valid HTML test: upload each html document to W3C's validator tool
https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file; 
expected result, tool reports no errors, warnings or errors

- Valid css test: upload each css document to W3C's validator tool
https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file
expected result, tool reports no erros , warnings, or errors
