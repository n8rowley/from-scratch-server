0: REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONS

- The result of this project is a group of interconnected html 
pages with several types of content
- The content of these pages will describe and provide practice
with several html and css elements

- Solution description: page style will be assisted through the
use of id's and classes. I'm not yet sure how to use both relative
and aboslute URL's

1: SYSTEM ANALYSIS

- Data includes html docs, css docs, and external reference webpages. 
- All blog page files will be in a common folder; links between
these files will be accomplished by means of relative URL's
- external webpages are links to MDN's website: links to these 
pages will be accomplished by means of absolute URL's
- Output: html pages that can be browsed in a local file system;
every page links to every other page; links direct the user to 
the new page without them having to know the file path
- algorithms and formulae:
- Each blog element will be contained in a `div` with a 
corresponding class attribute
- blog elements include: navigation bar (nav-bar); blog post 
(blog-post) cheatsheet (cheatsheet) biographical-block (bio); 
these classes assit with consistent formatting (font, size, etc)
across pages and sections
- cheatsheat definitions (def) will each be contained in a `div`
- each sequential blog post, cheatsheet, and plan section will
have a unique id; these id's assist with unique background colors 
and other unique details
- a css rule for links inside of definition divs to create
constency across the page
- all text elements will be contained in paragraph elements (<p>)
