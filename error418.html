        <h2>No Coffee here!</h2>

        <p>"Tea pots are generally short and round whereas coffee pots are taller and narrower.  The tea leaves go right into the pot first and then the hot water goes in second.  The traditional “brown betty” teapot allows the tea leaves to swirl and unfurl and creates a wonderful brew.  Of course, tea pots come in all shapes and sizes but the best for brewing will be the classic round shape, preferably with a built-in infuser."</p>
