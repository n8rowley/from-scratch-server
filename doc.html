            <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specifications</h2>
            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The result of this project is a Python program that runs a simple http server. </li>
                <li>
                    The server will respond to proper http GET requests and handle several different situations with appropriate
                    responses. Some of these situations include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Retreiving a page and successfully sending it to a user-agent based on a request for the page</li>
                            <li>Redirecting a user-agent to other pages</li>
                            <li>Blocking a user-agents access to areas they shouldn't access</li>
                            <li>Respond with an appropriate error message if a request cannot be handled</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>What I Know: </strong>the HTTPserver class defined by Python has functionality for many of the 
                    features/behaviors I need to include
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What I'm not sure about: </strong>Is my code still going to be long and verbose, or does the functionality
                    do so much that the resulting source code is stream-lined?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Phase 1: System Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The server is self contained in a single Python file. It will be run from the command line. The server will be 
                    listening on localhost and therefore never be exposed to the actual internet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    http request will be sent through a browser. HTTPserver knows how to collect the request, but leaves the details 
                    of handling the request to overridden methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Static html files will be accessible to the server because it will be running from the same directory where the 
                    files are located.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data will be transfered back to the user-agent by implementing HTTPserver methods and functionality
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Output</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When browsing to localhost:8000 on the source machine, a website will be available to view and navigate</li>
                <li>
                    Many pages will be the ones created for the previous assignment while others will be dynamically generated
                    and be new to this assignment
                </li>

                    What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
                    <ul>
                        <li> Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?</li>
                        <li>If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ANSWER: I think my server code benefitted highly from me spending a lot of time nailing down the plan and thinking through
                        all the sub problems before coding. Therefore, the messiest part is the messiness that was left over from assn0. THat is mostly
                        manifested through dissorganized css selectors. I additionally didn't have time to adjust the navigation bar to include links to
                        all relevent addresses for this assignment which shouldn't lose me points but possibly make the graders have to work a little harder
                        to grade my project

                    Will your document make sense to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>anybody besides yourself?</li>
                        <li>yourself in six month's time?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        ANSWER: It should make sense to those who've read the documentation XD. I think I've broken down functionality into 
                        small, bite-size pieces that may have been more granular than needed, but will make following, changing, and extending 
                        the code much easier in the future

                    How easily will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
                    <p>ANSWER: Shoud be really easy (see above)</p>

                    Will your program continue to work after upgrading:
                    <ul>
                        <li>your computer's hardware?</li>
                        <li>the operating system?</li>
                        <li>to the next version of Python?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        ANSWER: This program doesn't use any 3rd party libraries, just a few in the python standard library. The server should 
                        successfully serve files to any machine that uses the HTTP protocol correctly. It was written in Python3.8 so therefore must
                        be run with 3.8 or higher (this is a explicit Requirement).
