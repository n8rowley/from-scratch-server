            <h2>Phase 0: Requirements Specifications</h2>
            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The result of this project is a Python program that runs a simple http server. </li>
                <li>
                    The server will respond to proper http GET requests and handle several different situations with appropriate
                    responses. Some of these situations include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Retreiving a page and successfully sending it to a user-agent based on a request for the page</li>
                            <li>Redirecting a user-agent to other pages</li>
                            <li>Blocking a user-agents access to areas they shouldn't access</li>
                            <li>Respond with an appropriate error message if a request cannot be handled</li>
                            
                        </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>What I Know: </strong>the HTTPserver class defined by Python has functionality for many of the 
                    features/behaviors I need to include
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What I'm not sure about: </strong>Is my code still going to be long and verbose, or does the functionality
                    do so much that the resulting source code is stream-lined?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Phase 1: System Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The server is self contained in a single Python file. It will be run from the command line. The server will be 
                    listening on localhost and therefore never be exposed to the actual internet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    http request will be sent through a browser. HTTPserver knows how to collect the request, but leaves the details 
                    of handling the request to overridden methods.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Static html files will be accessible to the server because it will be running from the same directory where the 
                    files are located.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data will be transfered back to the user-agent by implementing HTTPserver methods and functionality
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Output</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When browsing to localhost:8000 on the source machine, a website will be available to view and navigate</li>
                <li>
                    Many pages will be the ones created for the previous assignment while others will be dynamically generated
                    and be new to this assignment
                </li>

                    What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
                    <ul>
                        <li> Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?</li>
                        <li>If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>ANSWER: My css selectors are spread sporatically between elements and classes. There's no good system
                       to explain when one is used versus another
                    </p>

                    Will your document make sense to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>anybody besides yourself?</li>
                        <li>yourself in six month's time?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        ANSWER: I'm realizing that classes help navigate through the source file. I think I've added just enough
                        class attributes to make sense of the general structure. I use a lot of nested lists and I'm sure those
                        are one of the most confusing parts. I bet the navigability could be improved by adding classes.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    How easily will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
                    <p>ANSWER: I may have to do some work adding classes; so as far as html goes, maybe not that easy.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Will your program continue to work after upgrading:
                    <ul>
                        <li>your computer's hardware?</li>
                        <li>the operating system?</li>
                        <li>to the next version of Python?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        ANSWER: This program doesn't use any 3rd party libraries. It is very basic HTML and should be rendered by all 
                        main-stream internet browsers. Best practices were used for syntax so the next version of html should 
                        support all features.
