# from-scratch-server
A server that is implemented using only Python

## Purpose
This server was given as an assignment to teach the basics of an http server. It provided an opportunity to learn the HTTP protocol and become intimately familiar with how it works as HTTP responses were built from the ground up.

I was assigned to create static HTML pages styled both with and without CSS to get experience with the classical methods for creating websites. 

## Running the Server

Navigate to the directory that contains server.py
Using Python3.8 or above, run the command

  python3 server.py
  
by default, the server listens on `localhost:8888`. This can be modified on line 106 of server.py

## Navigation

The entirety of the site can be navigated using the nav bar found at the top of each page (except the debugging page).
